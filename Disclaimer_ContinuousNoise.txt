3. DATA SPECIFIC INFORMATION
The Continuous Underwater Noise database hosts continuous low frequency sound monitored under the HELCOM programme in the Baltic sea, 
which users may query and download. 
These data are organised in deployments. If the queried data belongs to different deployments, one file per deployment will be included in the download.
Please note that in a single deployment there might be more data than in the download, in the case the deployment covers a greater time period than requested.
Additional data such as methods and quality assurance may be available. To have access to the complete data set, the user can request this by specifying the provided code plus the extra information required.
The soundscape maps were produced within the EU project BIAS LIFE11 ENV/SE/841.
